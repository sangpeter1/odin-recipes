            This is a classic <strong>chicke curry</strong> that uses a variety of a blend of whole and ground spices.
            This is another great recipe for the meal prep rotation. Also, chicken could  be easily substituted to make an equally delicious dahl curry.

                <li>Add oil into a pan or a wok and cook the whole spices in medium heat (cinanom, bay leaves, cumin, cloves, cardamons) for about one minute or as soon as 
                    the cumin seeds start to pop.</li>
